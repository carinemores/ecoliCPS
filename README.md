# ecoliCPS

## Introduction

`ecoliCPS` is a repository created to provide all scripts used to generate the genomes presented and described in the publication "Complete Genomes of E. coli with diverse K-antigens" by Mores et al. MRA (2023), including including setup, walkthroughs, example commands, and test data.


## 1. Installation Instructions
This project requires the installation of the following bioinformatics tools: Guppy v6.4.6, Flye v2.9, Pilon v1.23, and bbmap.

### Guppy v6.4.6
To install Guppy, follow the instructions provided on the [Oxford Nanopore Technologies website](https://nanoporetech.com). 

### Flye v2.9
Flye can be installed using conda:
```bash
conda install -c bioconda flye
```
### Pilon v1.23
Pilon can be installed using conda as follows:
```
conda install -c bioconda pilon
```
### bbmap-38.87
bbmap can also be installed via conda:
```
conda install -c bioconda bbmap
```

## Tool Dependencies and Notes

### Guppy v6.4.6
Dependencies: Compatible operating system, specific versions of Python may be needed. Requires hardware capable of supporting high-throughput sequencing data processing.

### Flye v2.9
Dependencies: Python (version 2.7 or 3.5 and later) and a standard C++ compiler. Performance varies based on Python version and C++ compiler.

### Pilon v1.23
Dependencies: Java 8 or later. Requires significant memory for processing large genomes.

### bbmap-38.87
Dependencies: Java 7 or later. Sensitive to Java version and memory allocation.

Note: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed before using these tools for optimal operation and accurate results.
